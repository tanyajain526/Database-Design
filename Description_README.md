**Database Design and administration for e-learning platform: Coursera**

**Overview:**
This project focuses on creating a comprehensive database for a Coursera-related application. The goal was to design, implement, and manage a database system that supports various business functionalities and data management tasks.
In this project, I designed and implemented a comprehensive database system to support various business functionalities for a Coursera-related application. The project involved creating an Entity-Relationship (ER) model and mapping it to a relational model, which I used to build the database schema using Data Definition Language (DDL) commands. I populated the database with sample data using Data Manipulation Language (DML) commands and developed SQL scripts to execute key business functionalities such as data manipulation and queries. My work resulted in a robust and efficient database system that effectively supports the application's requirements.
